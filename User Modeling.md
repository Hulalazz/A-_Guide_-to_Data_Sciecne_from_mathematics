# User Understanding for Recommender System

[The recommendation system, relying on historical observational data to model the complex relationships among users and items, has achieved great success in real-world applications.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3624986)

[But those static profiles don’t (fully) reflect users’ personalized preferences. In addition, most existing preference learning methods are based on users’ matching behaviors. However, matching behaviors are sparse due to the nature of PJF and not fine-grained enough to reflect users’ dynamic preferences.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-73197-7_24)

## User Modeling

[User models are used to generate or adapt user interfaces at runtime, to address particular user needs and preferences. User models are also known as user profiles, personas or archetypes. They can be used by designers and developers for personalization purposes and to increase the usability and accessibility of products and services.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/wiki/User_modeling)

### Modeling Users’ Preferences


> The ever-growing nature of user generated data in online systems poses obvious challenges on how we process such data. Typically, this issue is regarded as a scalability problem and has been mainly addressed with distributed algorithms able to train on massive amounts of data in short time windows. However, data is inevitably adding up at high speeds. Eventually one needs to discard or archive some of it. Moreover, the dynamic nature of data in user modeling and recommender systems, such as change of user preferences, and the continuous introduction of new users and items make it increasingly difficult to maintain up-to-date, accurate recommendation models.

## User Engagement

[User engagement measures whether users find value in a product or service. Engagement can be measured by a variety or combination of activities such as downloads, clicks, shares, and more. Highly engaged users are generally more profitable, provided that their activities are tied to valuable outcomes such as purchases, signups, subscriptions, or clicks.](https://mixpanel.com/topics/what-is-user-engagement/)

### Click Modeling

[Click models are mathematical models that attempt to do just that: Describe a typical userʼs decision process as he or she interacts with the search results page, so that we may infer said userʼs judgments on the relevance and irrelevance of specific search results.](https://innovation.ebayinc.com/tech/engineering/click-modeling-for-ecommerce/)
